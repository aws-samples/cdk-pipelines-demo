## TypeScript Release Notes

The `.ts` files are mostly the same as the `.py` with a couple of inline resources
pulled out for clarity.

The use of multiple jest configs is probably the wrong approach.

The CORS config for the REST API does not allow the integration test to run as intended and I
did not debug that yet.
